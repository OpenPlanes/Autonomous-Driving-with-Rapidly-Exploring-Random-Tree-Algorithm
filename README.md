# Rapidly Exploring Random Tree (Another Algorithm instead of A* and Djikstra
Self Driving Car using RRT Algorithm


A rapidly exploring random tree (RRT) is an algorithm designed to efficiently search nonconvex, high-dimensional spaces by randomly building a space-filling tree. The tree is constructed incrementally from samples drawn randomly from the search space and is inherently biased to grow towards large unsearched areas of the problem.
